# Freelance Work Profile Website

The purpose of the site is to provide information about my freelance services to prospective clients and provide contact details to both new and returning customers.

I primarily cater to local businesses, freelancers and charities. My clients are usually looking for a locally-based developer to work with and aren't usually interested in many technical details.

The site will be designed to provide easily accessible, relevant information to my target audience. I will use a responsive, mobile-first design to ensure the site is effective and well laid out across a range of devices.

Most users of the site will be either prospective new clients or returning clients. 

### New Client User Stories

## Organisation of Content

The site contains relatively few features and doesn't have a large amount of content to accommodate, so a single page with clearly delineated sections and a simple and always-visible navigation bar would be a good solution. Although the content could be spread across multiple pages, this would add an unnecessary  burden on the user to click between pages to load and view content. Some of the pages would also be quite sparsely populated with content. From an SEO perspective, it's generally considered better to have a single content-rich page than multiple thin pages.

Because the main purpose of the website is to describe and promote my services to prospective clients, content sections will be prioritised in the following order:

1. A home screen / hero area with a clear and concise description of the purpose of the site and the services available.
2. A section with further details on the services on offer. This will be more detailed than the hero area, but still concisely written.
3. A section featuring testimonials from previous clients.
4. A section with further details on myself, my experience and my work.
5. A section with contact details and a contact form.

N.B. Although providing contact details is a priority for both the business and the users, the contact details section has been placed at the bottom of the page for the following reasons:

* Providing useful information to new users is a higher priority than providing contact details. Most new prospective clients won't want to contact a freelancer until they have an understanding of the services on offer.
* There is a convention that contact forms are usually placed at the bottom of single-page websites. Many users will expect the form to be positioned there and can quickly scroll to the bottom of the page to find it. I don't see a good reason to break this convention here.
* The low positioning of the form / details will be mitigated by frequently placing buttons linking to the form throughout the other sections. This acts as a call to action and ensures the contact section is always readily accessible.
